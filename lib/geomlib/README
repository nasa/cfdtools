The geomlib collection contains single-function utilities arising from
geometric or graphical applications in 2- or 3-space.  See also the
gridlib and numodules collections for related utilities such as for
curvature calculations.

Note that the NEAREST_*_POINT utilities all return the point inside or on
the boundary of the specified cell along with interpolation coefficients
for that point, to be applied to data at the cell vertices.  The associated
squared distance may or may not be zero, because the returned point is not
allowed to be outside the cell being investigated.  This functionality is
key to the effectiveness of the ADT search packages for various mesh types
(see /adt).

Conversely, PROJECT3 and PROJECT4 allow interpolation coefficients to be
outside [0, 1], meaning the foot of the computed perpendicular may be
outside the indicated triangle or quadrilateral in 3-space.  But searching
cells until one is found for which all coefficients are within [0, 1] is
NOT the recommended strategy. The NEAREST_*_POINT utilities employed by the
ADT (Alternating Digital Tree) packages are likely to be preferable, as the
searches are not affected by whether the target point is inside the grid
being searched or outside it.  Two-space variants, nearest_edge_pt_2d and
nearest_tri_pt_2d, have most recently been prompted by the need to work with
Delaunay triangulations of (x,y) data.

Two recent additions, DETECT_VERTICES and VERTEX_CURVATURE, are now options
in CURVDIS[2] (see gridlib) as needed by the CAPSULE_GRID application.

Two more recent additions are also used by gridlib/curvdis.f: detect_flatness
and handle_flatness, for broadening high-curvature regions onto flat regions.

There are multiple ways of calculating the volume of a tetrahedron, pyramid,
and hexahedron, and their results differ slightly.  Those based on the tet
method found in Wolfram, V = | a . ( b x c) | / 6, and implemented in tet_vol
here, are the most efficient.
