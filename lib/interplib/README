More than 50 1-dimensional interpolation and smoothing utilities are
gathered in this collection.  Here, interpolation implies passing through
data points precisely, while smoothing methods of course may not.  Many
of the 1-D methods are driven by program SMOOTH, q.v., on one or more
datasets, either to generate usable results or to compare the methods.

Many methods require distinct, monotonic abscissas in the data; others
do not.  Some utilities simply determine and evaluate a certain function
(say a quartic) to fill some interval for given end-point conditions.

Past confusion of (x/y[/z]) methods involving curves in 2- or 3-space
mean some of what are really 1-D methods (single independent variable
such as arc length) appear in the interp2d and interp3d collections,
q.v., and remain there for historical reasons.

The local cubic spline method of LCSFIT and its relatives has proven
extremely valuable, particularly its monotonic option (meaning the
interpolations cannot experience excursions beyond the data points).
Local cubics involve the 4-point Hermite method (cubics defined by two
points and corresponding slopes), with adjustments for monotonicity if
desired. They ensure first derivative continuity at the data points,
but second derivatives may not be continuous.  Nevertheless, even for
geometric applications with smoothly varying data points, the lack of
curvature continuity has proven to be a non-issue.  The curvature-based
point redistribution in CAPSULE_GRID, for example, via the PLSCRV3D
utility (sadly in the interp3d collection, although it belongs here)
as well as LCSFIT, produces excellent surface grids from well-discretized
analytic (or nonanalytic) generatrices.

Note that finite difference derivatives are highly recommended for
calculating curvature -- not splines.  Also, the normalizing and denorm-
alizing done by LCSFIT2 around a call to LCSFIT is recommended unless
the data units are known to be O(1).

airfoils.
