!
!     This version of INTSEC6 was necessitated by the need to distinguish the
!  different forms of the ADT search package, one of which is used here.
!  The following documentation is retained from INTSEC6.
!
!  Purpose:
!
!     Calculate the intersection of a 3-space line or curve defined by two or
!  more points with a structured surface defined by one or more surface patches.
!  If the line and curve do not actually meet, the curve may be extrapolated
!  (tint outside [0, 1]), but the surface will not be extrapolated.  The point
!  on the surface nearest to the [possibly extrapolated] line will always be
!  determined.  The shortest squared distance returned indicates whether a true
!  intersection was found or not (although a tangential meeting is possible and
!  not easily distinguished).
!
!  Strategy:
!
!     The two-point line case is explained most readily.  Any point on P1 P2
!  may be represented as P(t) = (1 - t) P1 + t P2.  The surface quadrilateral
!  closest to this point may be determined efficiently via an ADT search of the
!  surface grid.  A 1-D minimization of the squared distance w.r.t. t solves the
!  problem.  In the case of a curve, the local spline method of LCSFIT can be
!  used similarly to calculate (x,y,z) as functions of normalized arc length t.
!
!  Outline of search tree construction:
!
!  nquad = 0
!  do ib = 1, npatches
!    nquad = (surface_patches(ib)%ni - 1) * (surface_patches(ib)%nj - 1) + nquad
!  end do
!
!  allocate (conn(3,nquad)) ! For patch # and (i,j)
!
!  call build_structured_surface_adt (npatches, surface_patches, nquad, conn)
!
!  History:
!
!  06/13/05  DAS  Initial implementation for the 2-point line case; leave hooks
!                 for the 3+-point line case, piecewise linear or not.
!  08/25/06   "   Completed the 3+-point case.  The fact that the arc lengths
!                 are normalized still allows tline(1) and tline(n) to be used
!                 to define the search interval (because we know those arcs are
!                 0 and 1), but two other arguments would have been better.
!                 The 0 and 1 have to be substituted here, then ta and tb are
!                 restored before the return.
!                 Requiring tline(:) as input (as opposed to deriving arcs from
!                 x/y/zline(:) here) is considered better since the application
!                 is likely to need those arc lengths anyway.
