!
!  Clarification of Input Generatrix Option:
!
!     Since an input generatrix may or may not represent the desired point
!     distribution in the output surface grid, the work-around is as follows:
!
!     If the number of points found in the input generatrix matches the spec-
!     ified grid point count, numi_forebody [+ numi_aft_body - 1], then the
!     input points are used without change.  Otherwise, the curvature-based
!     redistribution applied to the analytic case is applied likewise, and
!     the number of grid points can be adjusted to suit the intended flow
!     calculation.
!
!  Clarification of Curvature-Based Controls:
!
!     Fore and aft body generatrices are now redistributed separately for all
!     cases except a full-body input generatrix case where the output number of
!     points,  numi_forebody + numi_aft_body - 1, matches the input number.
!     (Originally, a full body input generatrix was treated as a single curve.)
!     Curvature-based redistribution may be controlled with exponent inputs
!     power_fore and power_aft, which default to 0.5 and should be in the range
!     [0.1, 0.9], with 0.9 maximizing the curvature effect.  If the iterative
!     solution does not converge, the exponent is lowered by 0.1 until it does.
!
!  "Umbrella" Forebodies:  Two Types of Deflection
!
!     Originally, faceted outer forebodies were constructed with straight-line,
!     undeflected ribs matching the cone portion of the underlying sphere-cone
!     generatrix, and any deflections were confined to the panels between the
!     ribs.  The "peak_deflection" input controls these catenary-type surface
!     deflections in both surface directions.  Now, a second rib_deflection
!     input allows the ribs to be bent in either direction (negative input for
!     a convex/outwards rib bend).  The initial discretization of the generatrix
!     is bent with a catenary-type deflection either inwards or outwards.
!     Blending at the circular shoulder is an awkwardness treated as follows.
!     The outer end slope of the nominal catenary is used to locate the shoulder
!     circle point with matching slope.  Then the nominal catenary is morphed
!     via an arc-length-based technique to move its outer end from the tangent
!     point of the straight cone line to that matching-slope circle point.  The
!     resulting blend is not perfectly tangential, but should suffice for small
!     deflections.
!
!  Definition of Frustum Radius:
!
!     Originally, "umbrella" cases assumed that the ribs started at the sphere-
!     cone tangency point.  Now, ribs may be shorter than that, to model an
!     effectively larger nose cap that includes part of the cone.  The control
!     input "frustum_radius" defines the start of the ribs where any deflections
!     may be imposed out to the shoulder tangency location.  Defaulting this
!     frustum radius to zero leads to use of the original definition, namely the
!     sphere-cone tangency point.  To be precise, any rib bending will start at
!     the first point of the eventual (redistributed) generatrix that is at or
!     nearest to (but downstream of) the location specified by frustum_radius.
!
!  Clarification of Aft Body ncones and Collapsed Aft Ends:
!
!     To avoid confusion, ncones is expected to be 1 for a single frustrum,
!     2 for a typical biconic aft body, and so on.  Normally, these cases have
!     a finite vertical end segment in the generatrix, where a half cone angle
!     of 90 degrees is implied and ncones+1 radii > 0 should also be entered.
!     Internally, r_aft(ncones+2) = 0 will be assigned for arc length calcs.
!
!     Conversely, if the aft end collapses to a point, r_aft(ncones+1) = 0.
!
!  Aft Body Vertex Rounding Options (Analytic Cases Only):
!
!     [Note that forebody rounding is limited to the one vertex of a biconic,
!     and is handled in the capsules.f90 forebody package via the radius_vertex
!     parameter.  Aft bodies are more general and any rounding of vertices is
!     handled in this program.]
!
!     rounding_mode = 0 turns off any rounding of [aft body] vertices;
!                   = 1 means input ds_round values > 0 are treated as tangent
!                       lengths from the vertex to the underlying circle;
!                   = 2 means input ds_round values > 0 are treated as radii
!                       of the rounding circle; ALSO: ds_round < 0 means a
!                       special case of rounding for SRC-type capsules with a
!                       quarter-circle quadrant for the aft-most segment.
!
!     If ds_round > 0 is specified for a vertex, a circular arc with ni_round
!     uniform points from tangent point to tangent point is inserted.  After
!     all insertions, the new geometry definition is redistributed to the
!     original numi_aft_body points using curvature-based techniques.
!     A collapsed aft body may also be rounded similarly: it is treated just as
!     for other vertices, but only half the circular points are inserted.
!
!     Note that ds_round(1) and ni_round(1) are ignored (no rounding at the
!     forebody/aft body juncture), but zeros should be entered as place holders.
!
!  Special SRC (Sample Return Capsule)-type Option (Full Quadrant Aft Body):
!
!     Use of ds_round(ncones) < 0. is the flag for a special case where the aft
!     body ends with a full quadrant (or a little less) that leaves no room for
!     normal rounding at the second last vertex.  A vertical segment is also
!     expected to precede the last vertex to be rounded.  Where that meets the
!     large aft circle has to be rounded after the normal rounding, because it
!     involves the vertical segment and what is now a large circular segment,
!     not a straight segment that would remain after less severe rounding of
!     the last vertex.  (Hard to explain!)  If the SRC-type aft body is not a
!     full quadrant, some geometry and trigonometry is required to determine
!     the last two r_aft inputs and the last cone angle implied by rounding
!     of the last vertex with the large radius of the less-than-full quadrant:
!
!        Rb = ds_round(ncones+1)  ! Large aft body radius of near-quadrant
!        xe = x_aft(ncones+2)     ! End of body, presumably known a priori
!        xo = xe - Rb             ! Center of large aft circle
!        xv = x_aft(ncones)       ! Vertical segment abscissa
!        tc = arcsin ((xv-xo)/Rb) ! The angle needed for cone_angle_aft(ncones)
!        ri = Rb*cos(tc)          ! Intersection radius needed for r_aft(ncones)
!
!  Handling of Aft Body 0, 180 and 90 Degree Half Cone Angles:
!
!     Note that if cone_angle_aft(j) = 0 or 180, the analytic specification is
!     not well defined.  The work-around is to enter the length of the step (in
!     the x direction) via r_aft(j+1); this will be reset to r_aft(j) internally
!     by the program.  For the 180 degree case, make r_aft(j+1) negative.
!
!     An interior angle of 90 degrees is also permitted without special handling
!     other than avoiding the infinite tangent internally.
!
!  Skirt Angle = Aft Body Half Cone Angle > 90 With Skirt Length < 0 (SRC-type):
!
!     The SRC-type configuration also requires an aft body cone angle > 90, in
!     combination with an equal skirt angle and a negative skirt length.
!
!  Aft Body Angle > 180 For Open SPRITE/ADEPT-Type With Flexible TPS:
!
!     The forebody/aft body juncture may need to be placed aft of the true
!     forebody shoulder via choice of skirt_length > 0 with skirt_angle = 15
!     say), combined with initial cone angles of 15 (say), 90, and 195 (say).
!     Looking at a working example is recommended.
!
!  Aft Body With "Umbrella" Forebody:
!
!     Default i1_umbrella and i2_umbrella = 0 (or umbrella_case = F) initially.
!     This suppresses the option for morphing an ADEPT-type aft body to an
!     umbrella-type forebody.
!     Pick indices on the resulting axisymmetric aft body spokes that make
!     sense for arc-length-based morphing (defining the essentially straight
!     line portions).  Outboard of that, the shoulder is simply shifted.
!
!     N.B.: These indices should be found from patch 7 of the interim surface
!     grid, NOT from the single-patch spoked_surface_aft.g file.
!     Also: for a fat aft body, if i1_umbrella on the aft body corresponds to
!     a radius that is greater than radius_frustum (where the forebody faceting
!     starts), use 0 < i0_umbrella < i1 to control additional morphing between
!     i0 and i1 because of the aft-body x-shifts from i1:i2 that maintain the
!     fabric thickness.  (Ideally these shifts go to zero at i1, but may not
!     for a fat payload housing.)  Default:  i0_umbrella = i1_umbrella - 20
!
!  Non-Analytic Full Body Case:
!
!     The inputs for numi_forebody and numi_aft_body should allow for a common
!     point where the two portions meet.  E.g., if 401 points are read in the
!     input generatrix, then 201 and 201 are plausible fore- and aft inputs.
!     See also "Clarification of Input Generatrix Option" above concerning the
!     sum of numi_forebody + numi_aft_body - 1.
!
!     If curvature-based redistribution is indicated, this is now done in two
!     parts.  The input geometry is split at the point of maximum radius, but
!     this can be overridden by entering ng_split > 0.  Keep in mind that the
!     split should be at or slightly aft of the shoulder max. diameter, for BC
!     and fore/aft block plotting purposes.
