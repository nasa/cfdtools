LINE_GRID Description:

Generate a 3-space grid between specified end points.  Write results either
as columns or for use as a PLOT3D file.

02/03/05  David Saunders  Initial implementation to generate target points
                          at which to interpolate CFD data for comparison
                          with wind tunnel boundary layer measurements.
                          Uniform distribution only, initially.
03/02/05    "      "      Kludged in a way of extrapolating, as needed for
                          generating a normal from adjacent radial grid
                          points.
06/30/16    "      "      2D/3D choice now; higher-precision output.
