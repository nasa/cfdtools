Radial_Interp Description:

   This program performs specialized interpolations for hypersonic grids
   and/or flow fields.  The radial grid lines of volume grids are assumed
   to extend from the body to the outer boundary for all blocks, and there
   should be only one layer of blocks.  This assumption allows rapid
   generation of volume grids from a given volume grid and a new surface
   grid.  The interpolation coefficients readily determined for the new
   surface grid points are reused to grow the corresponding volume
   quantities out from the surface parallel to the original radial lines.

   All files are PLOT3D grid and function files, formatted or unformatted.

Options:

   (1) Interpolate a new volume grid from a given volume grid and a new
        surface grid.  A flow field may optionally accompany the given grid
        and be interpolated to the new volume grid.  The given grid and
        optional flow solution may each be either vertex-centered or cell-
        centered.  Three of the implied permutations are relevant:

          (a) Vertex-centered grid + vertex-centered solution:
              flow interpolations are vertex-centered
          (b) Vertex-centered grid + cell  -centered solution:
              input flow is moved to vertices; cell-centered flow is output
          (c) Cell  -centered grid + cell  -centered solution:
              treated as for (a) but output flow is really cell-centered

       The new surface grid must be input as vertex-centered. For case (c),
       its cell-centered form is derived here.  The output blocks contain
       the same number of radial points as the initial grid. The degenerate
       case (nk = 1) is meaningful if a flow solution is present.

   (2) Interpolate a flow solution from one grid to another ([largely]
       consistent) grid.  The grids and flow solutions may contain either
       volume data or surface data (only).  The case of surfaces is the
       same as for option (1) with a flow solution present.  In fact,
       option (2) is distinguished from option (1) by nk > 1 in the new
       target grid.  In the case of volume grids, the old and new numbers
       of radial points may differ.

       Two sub-options are provided:

          (i)  is suited to fully consistent radial lines;
          (ii) is more general and is quite efficient if the radial lines
               are reasonably consistent.

       Option (2) is intended for situations such as where the new mesh has
       had its outer boundary moved closer to the body.  Again, the new
       target grid must be input as vertex-centered.  If necessary, its
       cell-centered form is derived here.

Assumptions:

   >  At solid wall boundaries (k = 1), all values are surface-cell-
      centered (no below-the-wall values).
   >  The same underlying geometry is represented by both surface grids.
      Any local discrepancies are small and corrected for.
   >  The new surface may be a reduced region (as for rapid interpolation
      of damage/repair volume grids and/or solutions).

Usage for Surface Damage/Repair Applications:

   Two runs of Radial_Interp are required if a new surface grid in the
   damage region is the starting point:

   (1) Generate a new volume grid from the old volume grid and new surface
       (vertex-centered; no flow interpolation), followed by
   (2) Interpolate a new solution from the cell-centered initial flow and
       grid, using the same new vertex-centered input surface.

   Treating the cell-centered flow separately (with the cell-centered form
   of the grid) is preferable to combining runs (1) and (2) because the
   runs are almost identical on different data.  A second reason is that
   the ADT search package cannot handle more than one surface to be
   searched simultaneously.

   Apart from avoiding unnecessary smearing of a finite volume flow
   solution during interpolation, the intended inclusion of "halo" cells
   in the cell-centered grids and solutions enables proper handling of
   boundary conditions, both at the solid wall and at the other outer
   boundaries of what could well be a reduced set of new grid blocks
   modeling localized surface damage or repair.  These halo cells can
   define the (frozen) boundary conditions needed for updating the flow
   in the damage region more efficiently than treating the entire config-
   uration, without significant loss of accuracy.

Algorithm:

   The assumptions allow use of surface searches (and possibly radial line
   searches) in place of volume searches, although the more general option
   (ii) for flow field interpolation still uses 3-D searches along the new
   radial lines.

   >  Read the full original volume (or surface) grid and associated flow
      solution if present.

   >  If an output grid is implied, read the full new surface grid
      (vertex-centered) and establish common edge info.

   >  If the solution is cell-centered but the grid is not, interpolate it
      to the grid vertices via averaging of neighbors.

   >  If the grid and solution are both cell-centered, convert the target
      grid to cell-centered form.

   >  Generate the ADT search tree from all patches of the new structured
      surface.

   >  For each block of the new grid:

      >  Read the new grid block (or copy it to the k = 1 plane if it is a
         surface already fully-read).

      >  For each point (i,j) in the new k = 1 surface face:

         >  Find the nearest original surface grid cell (ADT search).

         >  Any target point further than the distance tolerance from the
            original surface grid may constitute erroneous usage, but may
            also be the result of minor damage/repair; proceed anyway with
            the best surface cell found.

         >  Interpolate the original grid and/or flow solution to the
            current new surface point (bilinear within a single cell).

         >  If a volume grid is being generated,

            >  Apply the same interpolation coefficients to the successive
               k planes to produce the new radial grid line and corre-
               sponding flow if present.

            Otherwise, if a flow field is being interpolated (not just a
            surface flow),

            >  If the radial lines are consistent,

               >  Build a new radial line using the old grid as a template.

               Otherwise (a little more generally),

               >  For each k > 1, use the old grid cell indices found for
                  the previous k as good starting guesses for a RIPPLE3D
                  search for the current k.

               >  Simple use of TRILINT-type volume interpolation will not
                  suffice in the boundary layer.  Consider the case of a
                  new grid simply twice as dense as the old grid:  a new
                  in-between point at the surface could be significantly
                  far away from the foot of the projection to the nearest
                  surface cell in the old grid.  This offset must be taken
                  into account as we move off the new surface.  Thus, if
                  x0 is the foot of the projected normal for the k = 1
                  point x1, then for k > 1 we really search for the
                  adjusted point xk where xk = x(k) - (x1 - x0), not for
                  x(k).

      >  If the optional input flow was cell-centered and the grid was
         not, convert the interpolated flow to be cell-centered for the
         new volume block.

      >  Output the interpolated grid block and/or flow solution block.

History:

   04/13/04  DAS  Initial RADIAL_INTERP design:  James suggested adapting
                  GRID_INTERP (also James's idea) as a specialized
                  alternative to the fully general FLOW_INTERP.  It takes
                  advantage of single-layer-of-blocks topologies.
   04/14/04   "   Added output of interpolated surface grid as a check on
                  the surface searching behavior.
   04/16/04 DS/JR RIPPLE_SURF has been refined to balance the (p,q) and
                  distance tolerances.
   04/19/04   "   Count (p,q) deviations from the unit square and projected
                  distances above tolerance separately; make the distance
                  tolerance an input instead of some hard-coded fraction of
                  the data range.
   04/20/04  DAS  Merged the GRID_INTERP function into RADIAL_INTERP, which
                  now produces grids and/or flow fields.
   05/03/04   "   Added blanking capability: points near the open shuttle
                  trailing edge were being mapped to the wrong surface.
   05/20/04   "   Made extensions to ensure exact matches in common block
                  faces of interpolated grids.  Very grubby!
   05/25/04   "   Surface patch x/y/z extrema aren't always at an edge!
                  (Consider a wing tip cap.)
   05/28/04   "   Replaced RIPPLE_SURF approach with ADT search scheme
                  from Stanford.  (But RIPPLE3D is still used elsewhere.)
   06/07/04   "   The ADT scheme now works directly with the structured
                  grid (no need to repack the coordinates).
   10/20/04   "   Any left-handed output blocks are now made right-handed
                  by reversing the j indices.
   11/24/04   "   Two new "cell-centered" inputs allow application to
                  cell-centered flow interpolation (in a separate run from
                  the grid interpolation) without too many complications.
   01/19/05   "   Interpolating a flow solution with halo cells failed at
                  the start of block 2.  The common edge point data apply
                  to the new surface BEFORE recentering.  Not matching
                  common points exactly for flow interpolation is OK.
   03/24/05   "   Preserve outer boundaries precisely by decaying the
                  adjustment of each new radial line at the surface.
   05/02/05   "   Decaying can hurt at the outer boundary when higher
                  resolution is specified at the surface.  Carrying any
                  nonlinear effect of curvature at the surface all the
                  way out can actually be preferable for smooth surfaces.
                  Quick fix for now; do it more carefully at the outer
                  boundary some day.
   06/21/06   "   dtol = -0.0001 (say - i.e., negative) can now be used
                  to decay surface adjustments to zero at the outer
                  boundary as is prefereable for shallow cavities treated
                  as part of the main volume blocks.
   01/28/11   "   Chun Tang wondered if an option could be provided to
                  specify the spacing off the wall in the output grid.
                  He had thin inner blocks whose outer spacing needed
                  to be matched, but more conventional use on a single
                  layer of blocks may benefit from such an option.
                  Therefore, look for ds1 and ds2fraction on an optional
                  last line of the control file.  Optional blanking
                  inputs expected there at one time have been removed.
                  Initially, redistribute a vertex-centered grid only.
                  If the need arises for treating a flow solution
                  similarly, it appears that (for each radial line) the
                  cell-centered grid and flow would need to be converted
                  to vertices, redistributed, then converted back.  Do that
                  if it's ever called for.
   08/07/13   "   All ADT variants are now in a single module with generic
                  build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
