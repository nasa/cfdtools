Description:

      SCAN_GRID scans the specified block(s) of a grid to determine such
   characteristics as the data range. This version can also read a function
   file as might be needed to locate (for instance) maximum residuals in a
   flow solution.

Implementation Notes:

      Simply scanning all blocks sequentially would allow storing of only
   one block at a time.  However, providing an inner loop over index sub-
   ranges of a specified block makes it awkward not to store the entire
   grid.

      If a function file is present, the program does indeed store just one
   block at a time and allows just one of the functions to be scanned per
   run.  Use something like Tecplot to scrutinize particular points of
   particular blocks if function values are needed as well as coordinates.

History:

   01/11/00  D. Saunders  Initial implementation (PLOT3D grid data range),
                          using Mark Rimlinger's CFD_IO_PACKAGE.
   08/27/03   "      "    Provide data range for each block in addition to
                          the data range over the block range.
                          This can help identify (say) which surface
                          patches are which in a surface paneling.
   10/14/03   "      "    Tabulate block face corner (x,y,z)s as a visual
                          aid to determining connectivity.
   12/03/03   "      "    Tabulate the shortest cell edges for all blocks
                          in all index directions.
   10/20/04   "      "    Show the local normal if a single surface point
                          is specified when a subblock is scanned.
   12/17/10  D. Saunders  Switch from cfd_io_package to xyzq_io package,
             ERC, Inc.    and add handling of function files as needed to
             NASA ARC     locate maximum residuals.
