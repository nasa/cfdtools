RESHAPE3D Description:

PURPOSE:

   Utility to transform XYZ data in one or more ways at a time.

METHOD:

   > Deal with just one dataset at a time.  The simple format chosen is
     compatible with other utilities ("SMOOTH2D" format).  Actually, if
     the first line is found to be strictly numeric, the title and point
     count are assumed to be omitted.

        [TITLE
        N]                  <No. of pts - trailing text here is ignored>
        X (1)  Y (1)  Z (1)
         :     :            <Read list-directed, one triple at a time>
         :     :            <Additional columns will be ignored/lost>
        X (N)  Y (N)  Z (N)

   > Transformations are done in-place.

   > "Undo last" and "start over" operations are done with spare copies.

HISTORY:

   08/29/86   David Saunders   Initial implementation of RESHAPE for
                               XY data.

   01/17/88   Michael Wong     RESHAPE3D developed from RESHAPE.
                               Added features are translation and
                               reflection about the XY, YZ, or ZX planes,
                               Z shifting and scaling, and YZ or ZX
                               data switching.  Deleted feature is
                               rotation about point (p,q).

   12/24/97   DAS              Allowed for rotating Y and Z about (p,q),
                               as needed for pylon or fin sections.

   11/25/98   DAS              Allowed for up to 10,000 points.

   05/19/99   DAS              Minor Fortran 90 revisions.

   02/18/00   DAS              Added rotations about axes parallel to
                               the Y and Z axes for completeness.

   06/16/08   DAS              Added general rotation about an axis defined
                               by two points.  Free formatting now, and
                               dynamic allocation of work-space.  Guard
                               against displaying excessive amounts of data
                               for the "review" option.  Disallow starting
                               over and undoing if the number of points is
                               too large (as ~375000 seems to be).

   07/24/08   DAS              Display the data range and center (prompted
                               by dealing with clouds of laser-scanned data
                               rather than 3-space curves).

   08/13/08   DAS              Added splitting options.  Once a dataset is
                               split, only the upper portion of the repacked
                               coordinate arrays is operated on if further
                               changes are specified.

   10/07/11   DAS              Added the option to apply a rigid transform-
                               ation defined by new curve end points (rigid
                               if they're the same distance apart as the
                               input end points, that is, otherwise some
                               other result is obtained that may neverthe-
                               less be of interest).

   08/21/12   DAS              Added NULINE3D option for comparison with
                               RIGID_TRANSFORM (which indeed gives useful
                               results even if the transformation isn't
                               really rigid because the size is changing).

   04/06/18   DAS              Full precision output is long overdue.

   07/10/21   DAS              In order to test the revised CHANGEN, install
                               it as one more option here.  Raise the "undo"
                               limit significantly.  Add saving of before and
                               after cell growth rates for this option.

   02/04/23   DAS              This is as good a place as any to add a way of
                               calculating arc lengths.  It is written as a
                               fourth column immediately (no further trans-
                               formations).  See also CURVATURE3D.
